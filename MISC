- found something deep hidden in the python libs that does sexp parsing, it's pretty useless code, it seems to blank the file object after doing any process on it though. This won't be useful without 
much hacking. perhaps we should write a proper parser with SimpleParser instead?...  some test code:

import parser

foo = open('test.ds')
z = parser.parse_file(foo)
print z

- why did .ds switch to s-expressions from xml, xml parsing is builtin 
python libs, s-expression is almost non-existant without extra debs. :(

- the wnck stuff:

import wnck

screen = wnck.screen_get_default()

def winlistgen(screenname=screen):
	screenname.force_update()
	return screenname.get_windows()

def allwindows():
         print "List of windows:"
         print "----------------\n"
	 for i in winlistgen():
		print i.get_name() + " of application " + 
i.get_application().get_name()
		if i.get_workspace() != None:
                        print "It is on workspace " + 
i.get_workspace().get_name()
		print "At coords " + str(i.get_geometry()[0:2]) + " of 
width " + str(i.get_geometry()[2]) + " and height " + 
str(i.get_geometry()[3]) + "."
		print "\n"
allwindows()
